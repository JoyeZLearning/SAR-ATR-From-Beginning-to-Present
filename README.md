**An evolutionary tree of SAR ATR technology from the 1990s to present, organized into four primary branches based on target types: ships, vehicles, aircraft, and other targets. Branch nodes represent landmark methodologies, connecting lines indicate technological inheritance and innovation, while cross-branch linkages signal the emergence of generalizable models.**
